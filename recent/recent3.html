            Imagine that you are learning Mathematics. For understanding a new concept, you refer to different resources like books, research papers, videos, and search engines. After understanding the concept, you embark on solving a problem. During the solution finding process, you reach a dead end. A greater understanding of the topic is required, which is far beyond your limited knowledge base. Reaching out to teachers, friends, or any other intellectual support group, you expand your knowledge base and finally figure out the solution. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Be honest with yourself! How was the overall journey of learning the new concept and practicing it? Obviously, quite complex, frustrating, and tedious. However, consider that there was an alternative. All the resources required to learn a new Math concept, solve a question, and address any queries, were made available at a single website—only a button click was enough to access all of them. The journey of learning would obviously be fun! This is what Math World Nepal is building by the help of E-learning Module.
          </p>

            As the name suggests, E-learning Module is a project which MWN has embraced to build a blue print for learning Math online. The primary goal of this project is to create an e-learning website of Math World Nepal—the tool that presented all of our contents in a structured way. Throughout this project, MWN’s technical team and graphics team jointly coordinate with each other. The technical team comprises of Web Developers, who are responsible for all the coding. And the graphics team consists of graphics designers and editors who are responsible to create any original graphics needed for the website. After three months of hard work, we completed the first version of our website. <a href="https://github.com/KarkiAdit/mathworldnepal" target="_blank">Visit this page to see our open source-code.</a>.
          </p>

          <img src="../images/recent/recent3_image1.jpg" alt="E-learning theme" />

          <p>
            Our journey, coming up to the first version, involves a lot of planning, study, and exploration. We wanted to build this website in a professional way—that incorporated industry practices which are used in the modern day to build any e-learning website. To that end, we divided the technical team into two subgroups: one subgroup was of frontend developers and the other was of Backend developers. Frontend subgroup was responsible for creating the frontend designs of the website and backend subgroup was responsible for building the backend work cycle of the website. Both the subgroups had one member who planned the overall working architecture, scheduled meetings, and set weekly milestones. For any website issue, if coordination between two subgroups was needed, the technical head conducted a general meeting and the issue was addressed. Moreover, if any subgroup needed original graphics at any point, it immediately contacted the graphics designers, who readily helped the technical team every time.
          </p> 

          <img src="../images/recent/recent3_image4.jpg" alt="Designs of Website" />
          
          <p>
            Till now, we have been able to create a skeleton of the Graphics, the User Interface, and the Backend architecture of our website. This skeleton includes all the logos, cover photos, YouTube thumbnails, and project graphics. It also includes a Front-end user interface that uses modern web designs, which implement concepts like Neumorphism. Moreover, this interface also includes a mobile design, which ensures that our website is fully mobile responsive. Additionally, this skeleton includes server hosting and database management framework to manage the basic backend of our website.
          </p>

          <img src="../images/recent/recent3_image5.png" alt="Mobile responsive designs" />

          <p>
            While we have already launched the Beta-version of our website, we also have many important updates and long-term plans in queue. Beginning with the endeavor for creating an open discussion platform, we want to create a Quora-like feature in our website. This will include Facebook styled News feed, Status/Post section, and comment boxes. The idea is that the students can post their questions in the Status/Post section and anyone can share their opinions through the comment boxes; interested learners can learn through others’ posts in the News feed. Moreover, we also intend to add the feature of live sessions via Zoom or any video conferencing application in our website. As everything will be in one-button click, doing such a thing, eases the navigation process to all the tutoring and mentoring sessions of MWN. Additionally, we also aim to add 3D animations in our courses, which will help our learners grasp concept in a fun and unique way. For doing this, we plan to use Manim library of Python to code everything, build the 3D animations, and add them to the Courses page.
          </p>

          <img src="../images/recent/recent3_image6.JPG" alt="Quora Design" />
         
          <p>
            Furthermore, we also aim to improvise our current code using much more professional frameworks. For instance, our current front-end design uses Vanilla JavaScript for all the event driven inputs given by the user. Though using Vanilla is not a bad thing, it is considered plain JS and an outdated approach in the professional field of Web-design. So, we aim to implement modern frameworks like React.JS upon our current code. To that end, we hope to expand our team of Manim Animators, Graphics designers, and Web designers. Our expanded team will reach out to experts in their designated tech-field, understand the professional practices, and work together to renovate our website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, through E-learning Module, MWN will definitely build a strong technical foundation for learning Math online. This foundation provides tools to make quality Math content accessible, and the manpower to continuously improve it. Such tools and manpower give our website the wings to innovate the experience of learning Math online, which is itself the true meaning of digitizing the World of Math.
