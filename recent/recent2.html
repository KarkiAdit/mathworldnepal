            Rural outreach project, one of Math World Nepal’s core projects, aims to provide free tutoring and mentorship to students experiencing educational disadvantage in rural and remote communities in Nepal. To jumpstart this project, members from MWN conducted various sessions on Competitive Mathematics with students of Bloom Nepal school for three months.

            Bloom Nepal School is a network of schools established in 2013 with the goal of creating passion-based learning institutions, where students of all socio-economic backgrounds can come together for a shared purpose of intellectual development. Large number of students in this school come from a family with severe financial issues. Also, significant number of students don’t even have their own parents. During the pandemic, Bloom Nepal Foundation started the BloomED project, which aims to create an online platform for learning different high school level subjects in Nepal. Along this journey, they also created the Competitive Mathematics course, with an aim to help students prepare for Math competitions.

            What defines Math World Nepal is our goal to help as many students as possible to learn Mathematics in a meaningful way—in that, students use it throughout their life. Teaching Competitive Mathematics was a foot forward in doing so, because students learn to uniquely tackle Math problems while studying it. Covering starter-level college topics on disciplines like Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics, Competitive Mathematics provides students with an opportunity to master their concepts and comprehend tricky questions effortlessly. Such a course, provides conceptual clarity and encourages students to imbibe critical and analytical thinking. The importance of having these skills in learning, motivated us to help the students of Bloom Nepal School in learning the course that their own Foundation had created.

            The initial phase of our outreach was anticlimactic to say the least. Though the children were interested in Mathematics and were willing to participate in our sessions, they were just uninterested in learning vast concepts. It was because students were challenged all the time and they were not prepared for such a thing. Their previous classroom experiences very rarely induced logical and analytical thinking. So, we crafted a learning module where fun and learning was blended to create a memorable and knowledgeable experience for them. Through presentations, practical demonstrations of Geometric shapes, YouTube videos, open discussions, and interesting quizzes, we created an interactive and engaging environment, where students lost anxiety and felt free to express their ideas. Moreover, for ensuring that students continuously strived and embraced new challenges, we conducted sessions with Olympiad participants. In these sessions, the guests talked about their experience in the field of Competitive Mathematics and also recalled the glory of representing Nepal at the International Math competitions. In those sessions, you could see the gleam in the children's eyes as their interests and aspirations resonated with those participants.

            The difference between the first few weeks and the last few weeks was stark to say the least. The children, who were reluctant to try anything on their own in the initial weeks, transformed themselves to learn collaboratively. While solving any question, they requested not to aid, until they themselves attempted the questions. If anyone got stuck at any point, everyone in the class supported that person.  To my conscience, helping those children learn various disciplines, opportunities, and experiences of Mathematics has most certainly been a rewarding experience. However, the fact that the group of children we taught transformed themselves to be a more confident learner, was probably MWN’s biggest achievement. The radiance in the students’ smiles when they finally grasped an intricate idea or when they tackled the problems without anybody's assistance is unrivaled. We would like to thank Bloom Nepal school for providing us with this opportunity and are extremely motivated to work on such endeavors in the future as well.
