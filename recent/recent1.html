            Have you ever come across a thought that you had that one
            opportunity to show your mathematical ability? If yes, International
            Youth Math Challenge (IYMC) has given you the perfect platform to
            fulfill these inner aspirations. With over ten thousand math
            enthusiasts from almost hundred countries, IYMC engages you in a
            fierce, yet friendly, competition worldwide. Anyone strictly under
            19 years of age can participate in this competition which has three
            rounds: Qualification round, Pre-final round, and the Final round.
            Learn more about IYMC from the official website of the organizing
            committee:

            MWN wants to help students prepare for this event. To make this
            possible, our Content team is working on the Lets Talk Mathematics project. Under this project, content creators of MWN are making contents, which are closely
            related to the syllabus that IYMC tries to cover. Not only will
            these contents help learners understand the topics better, but also
            make them confident in solving various math questions. For achieving
            this, MWN has been creating quality interactive lectures and video
            solutions. Similarly, the informative articles and the mesmerizing
            blogs are sure to enhance our learners’ chances in the final rounds
            because they are profoundly researched and cover present day Math
            topics which IYMC focuses on. All these resources are readily
            available in our <a href="../index.html" target="_blank"> website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyk3jizAOeM7XgHNbGxqNnQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, which you can access in one button-click.
            Furthermore, we are always willing to expand our team to enhance the
            quality of content and ensure the smoother flow of topics to the
            math enthusiasts.

            When it comes to understanding the competition, the best place to
            get the primary information would probably be its website. However,
            if you are still stumbled upon something or have some unanswered
            questions, you can always contact us in our Discord server
            <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4kADpwN3P9" target="_blank"
              >https://discord.com/invite/4kADpwN3P9</a
            >. Two members from the MWN family have been serving as the
            ambassadors for IYMC from Nepal, and they are more than ready to
            personally mentor you throughout your participation. Additionally,
            we will also help you prepare for solving those questions from the
            IYMC set that require research. Our intellectual team, which
            contains bright math heads from all over Nepal, teachers who are
            spread over 21 districts in Nepal, and university students who are
            spread across the globe will be handy in helping us achieve this.

          <p>
            While it has almost been a year since the formation, the MWN team
            has taken quite significant leaps to help the students. For
            instance, we have been in close contact with the Olympiad
            participants to ensure that they guide students through webinars
            hosted live on Facebook Page of MWN. In the days forward, we aim at
            collaborating with math professionals to further strengthen the
            bridge between math enthusiasts and experts. 
            Apart from our regular duty of creating good content, we have been
            helping students, who have contacted us, either by solving their
            questions ourselves or by guiding them towards the resources of the
            questions.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/recent/recent1_image5.png" alt="Facebook conversation" />
          <p>
            In addition, most of the members of MWN are either high school
            students or high school graduates, who greatly excel in math. The
            common vision of all the members of MWN is to guide students
            systematically—by providing relevant information—to approach various
            mathematics tournaments. Most of the members of Math World Nepal
            exhibit a great mathematical ability and are willing to assist the
            next generation of math enthusiasts to not just delegate the country
            worldwide, but also bring home trophies and recognition. As a youth
            startup, we feel that this small help from our side could be a small
            peck to Nepalese students to further explore and delve in the field
            of STEM.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/recent/recent1_image6.png" alt="Blog sample" />
          <p>
            Most importantly, our goals as a group extends way beyond just
            making contents that prepare enthusiasts for various tournaments. We
            acknowledge that the core of mathematics is way beyond solving a few
            questions, and more focused towards the real-world application. As a
            result, through our networking with math experts, we have assured
            guidance in our research projects. Our research primarily focuses on
            identifying various factors in environment that might affect a
            certain change. Keeping Mathematical reasoning as fulcrum of our
            researches, we aim to tackle real-world problems by conducting a
            proper sample survey and doing a profound data analysis. 
          </p>
          <img src="../images/recent/recent1_image7.png" alt="Blog sample" />
          <p>
            Moreover,
            despite being focused on mathematics fundamentally, we plan on
            incorporating students who exhibit great computer/programming skills
            to bring even better presentations and math animations to our
            topics. All in all, our group aims at incorporating mathematics with
            other various fields to create our unique trademark—one that is
            unparallel to any limitations and delves deep into scientific
            knowledge for creating a World of Math.
