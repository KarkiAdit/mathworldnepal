            Have you ever come across a thought that you had that one opportunity to show your mathematical ability? If yes, International Youth Math Challenge (IYMC) has given you the perfect platform to fulfill these inner aspirations. With over ten thousand math enthusiasts from almost a hundred countries, IYMC engages you in a fierce yet friendly competition worldwide. Anyone strictly under 19 years of age can participate in this competition. Learn more about IYMC from the official website of the organizing committee: 
            <a href="https://iymc.info/" target="_blank">https://iymc.info/</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            MWN wants to help students prepare for this event. To that end, our Content team is working on the Lets Talk Mathematics project. Under this project, we are creating content that closely resonates with the syllabus covered by IYMC or any other international math competitions. Not only will these contents help our learners understand the topic better, but also make them confident in problem-solving. For achieving this, MWN has been creating interactive lectures and video solutions. Meanwhile, our informative articles and insightful blogs under every topic will surely enhance the chances of qualification in the final rounds. They are profoundly researched and cover present-day Math topics that IYMC focuses on. All these resources are readily available on our <a href="../index.html" target="_blank"> website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyk3jizAOeM7XgHNbGxqNnQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, which you can access in one button click. Furthermore, we are always willing to expand our team to enhance the quality of content and ensure a smoother flow of topics for our learners.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to understanding the competition, the best place for information would probably be its website. However, if you are stumbled upon something or have some unanswered questions, you can always contact us on our Discord server 
            <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4kADpwN3P9" target="_blank"
              >https://discord.com/invite/4kADpwN3P9</a
            >. Two members from the MWN family have been serving as the ambassadors for IYMC from Nepal, and they are more than ready to personally mentor you throughout your participation. Additionally, we will also help you prepare for solving those questions from the IYMC set that require research. Our intellectual team, which contains bright math heads from all over Nepal, teachers from over 21 districts in Nepal, and university students spread across the globe, will be handy in helping us achieve this.

          <p>
            While it has almost been a year since the formation, the MWN team has taken quite significant leaps to help the students. For instance, we have been in close contact with the Olympiad participants to ensure that they guide students through webinars hosted live on the Facebook Page of MWN. In the following days, we aim at collaborating with math professionals, further strengthening the bridge between math enthusiasts and experts. Apart from our regular duty of creating good content, we have been helping students who have contacted us, either by solving their questions ourselves or by guiding them towards the resources of the questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, most of the members of MWN are either high school students or high school graduates who greatly excel in math. One of our visions is to guide students systematically by providing relevant information to approach various mathematics tournaments. Most of the members of Math World Nepal exhibit excellent Mathematical ability and are willing to assist the next generation of math enthusiasts: not to just delegate the country worldwide but also to bring home trophies and recognition. As a youth startup, we feel that this small help from our side could be a small peck to Nepalese students to further explore and delve into the field of STEM.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, our goals as a group extend way beyond just making content that prepares enthusiasts for various tournaments. We acknowledge that the core of mathematics is way beyond solving a few questions and is more focused on real-world application. As a result, through our networking with math experts, we have assured guidance in our research projects. Our research primarily focuses on identifying various environmental factors that might cause a change in societal issues. Keeping Mathematical reasoning as the fulcrum of our research, we aim to tackle real-world problems by conducting a proper sample survey and doing a profound data analysis.

          <p>
            Moreover, despite being focused on mathematics fundamentally, we plan on incorporating students who exhibit computer/programming skills to bring even better presentations and math animations to our topics. In nutshell, MWN aims at incorporating mathematics with other various fields to create our unique trademarkâ€”one that is unparallel to any limitations and renovates learning Mathematics.
