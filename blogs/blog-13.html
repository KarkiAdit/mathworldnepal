          <p>
            Currently, Ed-tech platforms like Kullabs, Neema Academy, and Veda
            Guru are trending in the Nepali market. In other words, Ed-tech
            platforms in Nepal have the greatest attention in their entire
            history as the increase in the number of Ed-tech users is larger
            than ever before.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/blog/blog13_image1.png" alt="Ed Tech" />
          <p>
            It all started after the government of Nepal imposed a nationwide
            lockdown because of the first wave of COVID-19. Educational
            institutions forcefully shut down, and schools moved online. This
            shift was a U-turn for teaching-learning practices in
            Nepal—something apparent by all the schooling activities directly
            resulting from the online classes. PowerPoint presentations
            developed as a classroom practice because teachers used them as a
            helpful tool to make their lectures understandable. Homework was not
            just limited to books because the practice of giving projects and
            research works as assignments increased. Exam evaluation was not
            only about a three-hours-exam but also class engagements and
            discussions. And, as the learning practice itself, was never
            embraced before, students found it difficult to grasp concepts,
            which increased their culture of surfing the internet for additional
            resources
          </p>
          <img src="../images/blog/blog13_image2.png" alt="Homework report" />
          <p>
            If we think for a moment and recollect all these occurrences, we can
            figure out a flaw in our education system. It restricted students
            from understanding and using e-learning platforms—something visible
            by the post-pandemic boom of Ed-tech after the implementation of
            online teaching. I define this flaw as a lack of modernized teaching
            methods in our schooling practice and feel that public, state, and
            bureaucrats, are all equally guilty.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../images/blog/blog13_image3.jpg"
            alt="Everyone's responsibility"
          />
          <p>
            In Nepalese schools, technical resources are not available
            abundantly, which indefinitely limits modernized teaching-learning
            practice. The main reason behind this is how we utilize the
            governments' educational funds. Nepal spends around 10 percent of
            its national budget in the education sector. About 50 percent of
            this budget is consumed by basic and primary education, which is
            given compulsory and free of cost. A significant share of the budget
            also goes for distributing the teachers' salaries. Whatever amount
            is left is either used by bureaucrats to fill their pockets or used
            for some instantaneous educational purposes where there is no
            long-term vision. This leaves very little or no funds for the
            development of modernized teaching practices or very simply Ed-tech.
            So, public institutions are not sustainably financed, with a
            deficient budget allocation of state and corrupted bureaucracy being
            the main protagonist. Therefore, although private schools are
            working on developing Ed-tech, the public sector is lagging, which
            has resulted in the slow progress of Ed-tech in Nepal.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../images/blog/blog13_image4.jpg"
            alt="Government schools"
          />
          <p>
            With no absurdity, I also put forward the rationale that the public
            is okay with the country's current curriculum—for there are no
            efforts to change it, and if there are any, these efforts are
            minimal. And if we do not put even a small effort into making a
            change, it is completely irrational to say that we wanted to make
            that change. Instead, we have compromised with the current system,
            which I mean by putting forward the rationale that the public is
            okay with the country's curriculum. This reluctant nature of
            logically every citizen of the country has constricted students to
            read the same traditionally designed curriculum, with no modernized
            teaching methods, and indeed affected the growth of Ed-tech in
            Nepal.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/blog/blog13_image5.jpg" alt="We can" />
          <p>
            As Nepal is in a developing phase, education must be given top
            priority. And the Ed-tech market plays a significant role in this,
            for it prepares the students of today for the job of tomorrow,
            teaching them the skills which cannot be taught in class. Meanwhile,
            it is also crucial for the public, government, and bureaucrats to
            realize their responsibility because they must come together to grow
            the Ed-tech market in Nepal.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/blog/blog13_image6.jpg" alt="Responsibility" />
          <p>
            The road ahead requires the government to support financially in
            expanding the Ed-tech sector. It also requires the government to
            positively maneuver the curriculum to incorporate modern teaching
            methods inside it. On the other hand, the bureaucrats should be
            accountable for their work and remember that humanity is ahead of
            any value. Meanwhile, the government and the public sector can work
            together to check and balance the activities of the bureaucrats. The
            public and private sectors can set up non-profit organizations
            together. Such organizations will be pivotal in making students in
            deprived places aware of Ed-tech and its benefits.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/blog/blog13_image7.jpg" alt="Rule of Law" />
          <p>
            We, the youths of today, can also use the power of our actions and
            words to embrace modernizing the education of Nepal. Our efforts can
            be directed towards teachers—requesting practicality in their
            teaching approaches. We can also suggest CDC with techniques for
            improvement of the present curriculum. When all this happens, I see
            the Ed-tech market growing faster than ever before in Nepal.
